## Set a SwiftUI View as your AppCoordinator root

In order to use a SwiftUI in your UIKit AppCoordinator, you'll need to:

 1. Instantiate a **UIHostingController** and set the `rootView` to your SwiftUI View.
 2. Set the **UIWindow's** `rootViewController` to your **UIHostingController** instance.

``` swift
func start() {
	let floatingTabBar = FloatingTabBarView(selectedIndex: 1)
	let mainTabBarView = UIHostingController(rootView: floatingTabBar)
	window.rootViewController = mainTabBarView
	window.makeKeyAndVisible()
}
```
